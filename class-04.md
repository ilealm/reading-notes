# Read 04, Links, Layout, Functions, Methods, and Objects, and Reasons to programming

### February 5th, 2020

### _Links_
 * Links allow users to move from one page to:
    * Another page in the same window.
    * Another page in a different window/browser.
    * Another part of the same page.
* Links can start-up user's e-mail program.
* We use the &lt;a&gt; tag to create the link.

#### Link Syntax:

  ` &lt;a href="path"&gt;Path Description&lt;a&gt;`

### _Layout_
* All elements in the document (page) are treated like blocks.
* We can manipulate the margain, border and padding of each element.
* The float property moves elements to the left or right.

### _Functions_
* These are a piece of code that ejecute a definied tasks.
* We can create them, as well as invoque the ones that already existing.
* Functions can return a value.
* Functions can have their own variables.

### _“6 Reasons for Pair Programming”_

Well, at the beginning this article made me think about how it would be viable to work this way. Some times we have very clear the process of our code. But we may be doing something that can be improved, and in that case, a second pair of eyes can come handy.

For coaching peers, I love this concept. Also I do believe that helps to two people works together on the same idea or problem. The soluction will have the best of all people involved.

The jobs skills that this practice will enhance is a great cuality of this approach.

With out a doubt, is a practice that we can learn a lot, and improve the code.
