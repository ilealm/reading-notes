### February 19th, 2020

This article vas very interesting to me, because it treats a very scencial quality of human beens: to be and behave wiht other people.

The idea of having the perfect formula to create a team is a wild fantasy, but sometimes can be achieved but as everyting that involves human, there has a work to be done.

This work have to be done by all the members in the team, even the ones who are not directly involved.

I do see very important and productive to have at least one "honor to truh" meetting at the beggining of a project, so each team member can feel free to share how they like to work, what things are importan to them, and what things are beyond the line.

We have to remember that in a team, or in life really, we should give what we want to receive. If we are expecting respect from others, we must show respect to others, if we want to be heared, we must hear others and don't interrupt when they are speaking.

Each team's member have they own energy, and this energy affects the team's energy. We must take a time to reflect on which energy are we giving, and if this energy is possitive to the team. We always have te power to control our attitude.
