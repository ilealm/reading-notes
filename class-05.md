### February 6th, 2020

### _Images_
* Is a good practice to have a dedicated folder for all the images of the project.
* Some of the most useful properties are: src, alt, title, height and width.
* Using images's align attribute is not used any more. This is manipuladed by stylesheets files. 
* Images are inline elements, which means they don't start in a new line. 
* Is important to think in the funcionality of the images, so the author can decide between formats and resolution.


#### Image Syntax:

  ` &lt;img href="path"&gt;Path Description&lt;a&gt;`
