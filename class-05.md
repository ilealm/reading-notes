# Read 05 Images, Color and Text

### February 6th, 2020

### _Images_
* Is a good practice to have a dedicated folder for all the images of the project.
* Some of the most useful properties are: src, alt, title, height and width.
* Using images's align attribute is not used any more. This is manipuladed by stylesheets files. 
* Images are inline elements, which means they don't start in a new line. 
* Is important to think in the funcionality of the images, so the author can decide between formats and resolution.

### _Color_
* There are 3 ways to specify color in HTML: RGB values, hex codes and color names.
* Is importan to have contrast between text and background.
* RGBA is a extra value of color that integrates opacity.
* Color property can be manipulated in the element tag or by un style sheet.

### _Text_
* Is importan to have a clear idea of the intended look and feel of the page, so the author can pick the correct font for the page.
* We can declare the size of a text by: pixels, percentajes and ems.
* Not all the fonts are supported in all browers, therefore is important to declare more tan one in the project.
* Text can be widly manupulated by their properties.
* Is possible to manipulate the first letter or first line of a text.
* Text can respond to events.
