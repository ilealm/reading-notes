### February 10th, 2020


### _Domain Modeling_
* This refers to the problem solving thru the creation of an conceptual model in code to solve something in particular.
* This model must include all the constrains of the problem.
* This approach includes the creation of objects which will interact with the code.  

### _Tables_
* A table represents information in a grid format.
* Contains the next tags: table, tr, td, th.
* We can manipulate the appereance of the table.
* We can combine cells or columns.

### _Functions, Methods, and Objects_
* An object is a representation of an entity.
* This object can have properties (values) and methods.
* We can access to the object's properties and manipulate the value.
* An advantage of the objects, are the use of the _this_ reference to the object itself.
* To use and object, we have to create an instance of the object.
